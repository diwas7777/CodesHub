# Documentation Website

## Overview

This directory contains a static documentation website for the main repository. It is designed to provide an overview of the project, showcase the programming languages used, and list recent changes. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is compatible with GitHub Pages.

## How it Works / Features

The website dynamically displays:
- **Programming Languages:** Presented as interactive "cards" in a folder-like format. Each card shows the language name and a count of its top-level files and projects.
- **Language-Specific Details:** Clicking on a language card reveals a detailed list of its top-level files and sub-projects directly within a dynamic section on the main page. This allows for quick exploration of each language's contents.
- **Recent Changes:** A list of the 10 most recent commit messages from the repository.

This information is sourced from the `docs/site_data.json` file.

The `docs/site_data.json` file is, in turn, generated by the Python script located at `docs/scripts/generate_site_data.py`. This script now:
1. Scans the root of the repository (e.g., `../../` from its own location) to identify language-specific directories by looking for top-level folders that are not hidden (e.g., not starting with a `.`) and are not common non-code directories like `docs/`, `.git/`, or `.github/`.
2. For each identified language directory, it recursively scans for files with supported extensions (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.java`) to gather information like filename, size, and last modified date.
3. Fetches the latest commit history using Git commands for the entire repository.
The script then compiles this information into the `site_data.json` file.

## Updating the Website Content

To refresh the language information (including the detailed file lists) and recent commits displayed on the website, you need to regenerate the `docs/site_data.json` file. Follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the script directory:**
    Open your terminal and change your current directory to `docs/scripts/` relative to the repository root:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/repository/docs/scripts/
    ```

2.  **Run the generation script:**
    Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python generate_site_data.py
    ```
    *(You might need to use `python3 generate_site_data.py` depending on your system's Python installation and PATH configuration.)*

    This command will update the `docs/site_data.json` file with the latest, detailed structural information and commit history.

3.  **Commit and push the changes:**
    After running the script, you should commit the updated `docs/site_data.json` file to your Git repository:
    ```bash
    git add ../site_data.json
    git commit -m "docs: Update site_data.json with latest languages, files, and commits"
    git push
    ```

**Requirements for the script:**
- Python 3 is required to run `generate_site_data.py`.
- The script uses standard Python libraries (`os`, `json`, `subprocess`) and requires `git` to be installed and accessible in your system's PATH for fetching commit history.

## Viewing Locally

To view the documentation website locally:

1.  Ensure that `docs/site_data.json` has been generated (run the script if not).
2.  Navigate to the `docs/` directory in your file explorer.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Automatic Updates (GitHub Pages)

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/generate_docs.yml`) is in place to automate the execution of the `generate_site_data.py` script. This workflow triggers on every push to the `main` branch, automatically updates `docs/site_data.json`, and commits the changes. This ensures that the live documentation site hosted on GitHub Pages remains consistently up-to-date with the repository's latest state.
