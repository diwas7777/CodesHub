# Code Standards and Best Practices

## General Principles

1. **Clarity over Cleverness**: Write code that's easy to understand
2. **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the repository
3. **Documentation**: Every piece of code should be self-explanatory
4. **Modularity**: Create reusable, focused functions and classes
5. **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling and validation

## Language-Specific Standards

### Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for all functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names
- Implement proper exception handling

### JavaScript Standards
- Use ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces)
- Use meaningful function and variable names
- Include JSDoc comments for functions
- Handle asynchronous operations properly

### Java Standards
- Follow Oracle Java conventions
- Use proper access modifiers
- Include Javadoc comments
- Follow object-oriented principles
- Handle exceptions appropriately

### C/C++ Standards
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include proper header guards
- Document function signatures
- Manage memory appropriately
- Use meaningful variable names

## File Organization Standards

### Header Template
```
/**
 * File: filename.extension
 * Description: Brief description of the file's purpose
 * Author: Your Name
 * Date: YYYY-MM-DD
 * Language: Programming Language
 * Category: algorithms/data-structures/games/utilities/etc.
 * 
 * Time Complexity: O(notation)
 * Space Complexity: O(notation)
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - List any external libraries or dependencies
 * 
 * Usage Example:
 * Brief example of how to use the code
 */
```

## Testing Standards

### Include Test Cases
```python
# Example for Python
def test_algorithm():
    """Test cases for the algorithm."""
    # Test case 1: Normal input
    assert algorithm([1, 2, 3]) == expected_output
    
    # Test case 2: Edge case
    assert algorithm([]) == expected_output_empty
    
    # Test case 3: Error case
    try:
        algorithm(None)
        assert False, "Should raise ValueError"
    except ValueError:
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_algorithm()
    print("All tests passed!")
```

## Documentation Standards

### README Requirements
Each directory should have a README.md containing:
- Purpose and scope of the directory
- List of files with brief descriptions
- Usage examples
- Requirements/dependencies
- Installation instructions if needed

### Code Comments
- Explain **why**, not just **what**
- Use comments for complex logic
- Avoid obvious comments
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs
- Avoid hardcoded credentials
- Use secure random number generation
- Sanitize file paths and names
- Handle sensitive data appropriately

## Performance Guidelines

- Choose appropriate algorithms for the use case
- Consider time and space complexity
- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile code when performance is critical
- Document performance characteristics
